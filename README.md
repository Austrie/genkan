# Genkan (玄関)

Genkan (named for the entryway in Japanese architecture) is the Kitsu service which manages issuance of authentication tokens, creation of accounts, and password resetting.  Effectively, it is the entryway to our site.

Genkan consists of a GraphQL API, an OAuth2 Provider, and a few legacy API endpoints.
